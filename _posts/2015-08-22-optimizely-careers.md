brief: HackBU is a hackathon at Binghamton University where students come to build and launch web projects over the course of a single weekend. The event had to be appealing to both experienced programming students and beginners looking to get their feet wet.
highlights: Hackathons are known for their collectable swag, and I really enjoyed creating t-shirts, notebooks and stickers that stayed with the students long after the weekend ended. The furthest destination reached by HackBU swag? One shirt got sent to a Binghamton exchange student living in Morocco.
