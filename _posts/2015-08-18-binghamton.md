brief: As a junior graphic designer at Binghamton University's office of marketing and communication, I designed for many kinds of print collateral including travel books, brochures, posters, postcards, business cards, and newsletters. Each project gave me a new opportunity to tell the story of life at Binghamton.

highlights: I studied and worked at the university simultaneously, meaning I had to design for myself as the target audience. Usually this made for an interesting challenge, although it ended up being more nerve-wracking as graduation loomed. As a bonus, I often got to include photos of my friends in my work &hellip; sometimes to their dismay.
