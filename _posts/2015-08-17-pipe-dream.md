brief: When I ran for Managing Editor of Pipe Dream my sophomore spring, I pledged to bring our scrappy self-funded student newspaper into the 21st century (of print design). After the election, I switched the paper from tabloid to broadsheet format to accommodate more creative layouts and completely overhauled our styles.
highlights: Since Pipe Dream is an entirely independent entity, we as students embraced the responsibility of keeping it running year after year. Twice a week, the team banded together to sell ads, write articles and design content to produce a product for the entire student body. Seeing your work printed 3,500 times around campus was an extra plus.
