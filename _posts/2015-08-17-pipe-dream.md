brief: As managing editor, I implemented a transition from tabloid to broadsheet format and completely redesigned the print edition.
highlights: Hackathons are known for their collectable swag, and I really enjoyed creating t-shirts, notebooks and stickers that stayed with the students long after the weekend ended. The furthest destination reached by HackBU swag? One shirt got sent to a Binghamton exchange student living in Morocco.
