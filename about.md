<div class="about-text">By now, you’ve probably surmised that this is the design portfolio of Jules, sometimes known as Julia, Forrest.  </div>

<div class="about-text">I studied graphic design at Binghamton University, where I spent four nocturnal years making newspapers in the basement of the “New Old New New Union West.”  I feel feelings about fresh pepper, typography, Curtis Sittenfeld books and  the Avett Brothers.  </div>

<div class="about-text">I currently work at Optimizely in San Francisco. Feel free to get in touch at julesforrest@gmail.com.</div>
