<div class="intro">

<p class="about-text">This portfolio site is inspired by many designers who came before me, notably including Jessie Ren, Nicholas Felton, Bethany Heck, Lauren Hom, and the folks at Focus Labs.</p>

<p class="about-text">The type is set in Freight Text and Rooney Web Sans, with nuggets and captions in Proxima Nova Soft. </p>

<p class="about-text">The site itself was built on Thoughtbot's Bourbon, Neat and Bitters, with the help and patience of Daniel O'Connor. It lives on Github Pages and is powered by Jekyll. </p>
